// game is gonna be played against computer
// create a function called 'computerPlay' that will randomly return either 'Rock' , 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
// Write a function called 'playRound' that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors
// The function should take two parameters(playerSelection, computerSelection) {

    // - make the two parameters lowercase
    // - return a string that declares the winner of the round
    // - there can only be 4 possible outcomes:
    // - 1. "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
    // - 2. "You Lose! Scissors beats Paper"
    // - 3. "You Lose! Rock beats Scissors"
    // - 4. "It's a tie! You selected the same item."
    // - "You Lose!" will be replaced by "You Won!" if the playerSelection is the winner;
// }

// Write a new function called game() {

    // use the computerPlay function inside this one to play a 5 round game
    // we need 2 variables to keep track of the score for both players
    // variables should be initiated with 0
    // if one player wins a round, his variable should increase by 1;
    // if it's a tie round, both variables will remain the same;
    // use console.log after each round to display the score;
    // when one of the variables reaches value = 5, return a message like so 'Player Won' / 'Computer Won'
// }

// use 'prompt' to get input from the user;
